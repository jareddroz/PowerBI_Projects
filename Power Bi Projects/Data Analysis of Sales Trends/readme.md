Data Analysis of Sales Trends : In my Pizza Sales Analysis project, I utilized the data analytics capabilities of Power BI to conduct a thorough examination of sales data in the pizza industry. My role involved extensive data cleaning, aggregation, and the creation of meaningful visualizations. I scrutinized sales and order data across various time frames to identify trends and patterns, providing valuable insights for decision-makers. Furthermore, I segmented sales aspects based on pizza name, size, and category, offering a granular view of the business's performance. This project exemplifies my proficiency in data analysis and visualization, showcasing my ability to extract actionable insights from complex datasets. It serves as a testament to my analytical skills and my capacity to present findings in an accessible and informative manner, making it a valuable addition to my portfolio.
