Driving Nike's Success - Power Bi Data Analysis : I led a comprehensive data analysis project focused on Nike's sales and profits, leveraging the power of Microsoft Power BI. In this dynamic and interactive exploration, I meticulously performed data cleaning, created essential measures, and dissected Nike's financial performance based on sales and profits. Using intuitive slicers for Year and Region, I designed a user-friendly interface for diving into Nike's financial data. The project showcases visually rich data visualizations, including insights into product performance, monthly trends, regional impacts, and sales methods. By combining technical proficiency in Power BI with a keen analytical mindset, I provided actionable insights to uncover patterns, trends, and opportunities within Nike's sales data. This project not only demonstrates my proficiency with data analysis tools but also highlights my ability to communicate complex data findings in an accessible and engaging manner. This endeavor serves as a testament to my data analysis skills, and the interactive nature of the project makes it a valuable asset for stakeholders seeking to understand and optimize Nike's sales and profit performance.
