Data Manipulation and Reporting : In my Zomato Data Analysis project, I leveraged the capabilities of Power BI to conduct a comprehensive analysis of Zomato's extensive dataset. My responsibilities included data manipulation, cleaning, and the creation of insightful visualizations. I meticulously analyzed and visualized data based on average ratings, average costs, and cuisines served, with a focus on providing region-specific insights. This project enabled a deep dive into Zomato's culinary landscape across various regions, shedding light on consumer preferences and restaurant performance. By combining data analysis skills with Power BI expertise, I delivered actionable insights that can inform strategic decision-making for Zomato and other stakeholders in the food industry. This project exemplifies my proficiency in data analytics and my ability to extract valuable insights from complex datasets, making it a valuable asset in my portfolio.
