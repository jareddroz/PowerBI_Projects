Attrition Analytics : In my project focused on attrition, I harnessed the power of Microsoft Power BI to create a dynamic and interactive analysis that delved deep into the reasons behind employee turnover within a company. Through the strategic use of parameters, I made the project adaptable and user-friendly, allowing stakeholders to explore attrition factors effortlessly. This project comprises a suite of data visualizations designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of attrition drivers. By dissecting employee demographics, performance metrics, and workplace conditions, I aimed to uncover insights that contribute to attrition rates. The interactive nature of this analysis empowers organizations to identify pain points and implement data-driven strategies to mitigate attrition, fostering a more engaged and productive workforce. This project showcases my ability to transform complex HR data into actionable insights, making it a valuable resource for HR professionals and decision-makers.
